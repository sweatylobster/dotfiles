Tried out LazyVim, and I like it. But it's a lot.
I also will live and die by [tpope/vim-surround.](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
Maybe I'll rebind mini-surround in the future.

Anyway, this is what you get when you follow [Elijah Manor's awesome video on lazy.nvim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqlxqpHs-aQ), copy [the Primeagen's keybindings] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE), and [Jess Archer's keybindings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=434tljD-5C8&t=687s)

Enjoy.
